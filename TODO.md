# TODO

- Improve speed -> cell bounds = 100
    - Optimize: HOW?
        - (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/v7yn13/optimization_questions_about_c_and_cellular/)
    - Is VECTOR slower than arrays/other methods?
        - Replace 3d vector with 1d vector
    - Things to try:
        - Calc on GPU?
        - Branchless programming?
        - Multithreading?

- Shaders to make cells eaiser to see?

- Cleaning:
    - 'f' on floats? when float, when int?
    - when is casting needed, when is it exessive?
    - floor division?

- On demand changes for bound, cell rules, (colors, etc)
- Menu screens etc?
