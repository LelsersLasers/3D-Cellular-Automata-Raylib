# TODO

- The actual 3d cellular automata
    - Does it work?
- Fullscreen is rather "janky" feeling when it goes into fullscreen mode
- Why is there a shadow max for CELL_BOUNDS?
- Left bar text as for loop?
    - Format: closer together
- Von Neumann and moore rule options
- On demand changes for bound and cell rules
- All features from previous version
    - Draw modes?
- Menu screens etc?
